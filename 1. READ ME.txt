1. Open root.py in your favorite editor (like Sublime) and run (CTRL + B in Sublime). 
	
2. To import your own music files, add a copy of the SAME file in PNG and GIF format to the /Samples directory. This is the default file directory, but you can always enter a different one in the entry field in the program (ie. ~/Desktop/MusicFile) *dont use an extension when entering into the entry field.

Make sure the fileName is the same, just the file extension is different. It’s typically not enough to just change the name of the file to your desired extension, so you’d have to use an online converter PNG to GIF converter.

Taking screenshots of a piece of music online will save the file as a PNG on your desktop, and then you can convert it to GIF and put it in the relevant directory.  

3. Huge thanks to “https://www.online-convert.com” for help with converting and trimming audio.
