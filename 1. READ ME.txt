# PyMusic!   

Welcome to PyMusic, a sheet music reader. 

## Get Started

1. Open root.py in your favorite editor (like Sublime) and run (CTRL + B in Sublime). 
	
2. To import your own music files, add a copy of the SAME file in PNG and GIF format to the /Samples directory. This is the default file directory, but you can always enter a different one in the entry field in the program (ie. ~/Desktop/MusicFile) Avoid extensions when entering into the entry field. Dont forget to use a .gif! 

3. Huge thanks to “https://www.online-convert.com” for help with conversions and trimming audio.

4. Credit for the module manager goes to Austin Chick (aschick) 

5. This program is made purely for educational purposes.
